Effectively debugging distributed systems almost always requires inspecting more than just your Prometheus metrics data - logs, traces and profiles all provide essential information that help you quickly and efficiently pinpoint the root cause of your bugs. 

However, navigating between different systems with disjointed data sources interrupts your debugging flow state and ultimately increases the time taken to identify and resolve your bugs. Wouldn't it be nice if Prometheus had a native capability to help you hop between data sources? Enter exemplars! 

In this beginner-focused talk, Ian Billett will walk you through what exemplars are, how they work and provide practical examples of how you can leverage them in your applications today to super charge your debugging experience.
