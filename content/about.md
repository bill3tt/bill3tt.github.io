Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ian, often known as [billett](https://twitter.com/billett_) on the internet, and this is my website ðŸŽ‰

I am currently an SRE at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company) where I work on the [Ticker Plant](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/how-bloomberg-handles-a-massive-wave-of-real-time-market-data-in-microseconds/) - the core engine that ingests and processes financial data from across the globe. 

Previously, I have worked at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) and the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/). See [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-billett-5501a35a/) for more info.

I'm passionate about building systems and engineering organisations that are stable, secure, performant and ultimately [boring](https://boringtechnology.club/).

I pride myself being able to find simple ways of communicating complex ideas - check out my [conference talks]({{< ref "/tags/talk" >}}).

Feel free to reach out and say hello either on the socials linked below or via email at my first name at my last name dot me.

See ya!
