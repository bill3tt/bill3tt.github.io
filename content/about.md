Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ian, often known as [billett](https://twitter.com/billett_) on the internet, and this is my website ðŸŽ‰

I currently lead the team building and running [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en)'s internal observability platform. Previously, I worked at [Improbable](https://www.improbable.io/) and the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/).

I'm passionate about building systems that are stable, secure, performant and ultimately [boring](https://boringtechnology.club/).

I pride myself being able to find simple ways of communicating complex ideas - check out my [conference talks]({{< ref "/tags/talk" >}})



Feel free to reach out and say hello either on the socials linked below or via email at my first name @ my last name dot me.

See ya!
